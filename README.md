## Description

The Simps Quiz web app allows users to view a publicly avaliable list of quizzes that anyone can take and see their results instantly. Users will be able to copy the URL of their results page and share that with anyone. Upon clicking the reults button, users will be redirected to retake the quiz while simultaneously copying the URL of their results for them to share. Users can also create their own quizzes which can be set to private so that they can only be accessed if the user knows the corresponding URL with that quiz. Quizzes contain one question with four potential answers, upon selection an alert is triggered to let you know whether you were right or wrong. Users will also have the ability to copy URL of certain quizzes from the homepage by clicking the copy button underneath that quizzes info.
